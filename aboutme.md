I'm Varun, I'm a computer vision engineer at [Mighty AI](mty.ai). My areas of interest include object detection, segmentation, and face recognition. I'm also fascinated by [GANs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) and their applications.

I'm originally from Bangalore, India. I've spent the last five years in different parts of the US.
